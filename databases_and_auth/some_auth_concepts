1)Hashing - hashing of password is done 
converting simple stiring to complicates jibrish
hashed password cant be decrypted manually
1 way
2) Encryption - 2way 
converts password to jibrish 
but we have key which decrypts it 
3)JSON WEB TOKENS (JWT)- only works for JSON input 
gives you a very long string
token - gives you a token at the end (long string)// add authorization as a header in postman and put this tomen there to get data
whoever have output can see the input
jwt.verify --> they verify the long string and the password 
cant be verified by all but hashed string can be converted to input
