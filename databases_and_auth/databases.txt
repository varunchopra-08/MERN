in memory objects are big no no
in real world we have cluster multiple backends 

Full stack Application
Browser 
backend
Database there are more but till now these are some

#Types of Databases
Graph DB 
Vector DB 
SQL DB
NoSql DB

Mongo DB (NOsql db)
creates tables(collections)
lets you dump JSON data in each table 
schemaless //no need to define structure of schema 
scales well

--> How does backend connect to database?
using libraries!
1. Express lets u create http server 
2. jsonwebtokens lib lets you create jets
3. Mongoose lets you connect to your database
Let's face it, writing MongoDB validation, casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag. That's why we wrote Mongoose.
